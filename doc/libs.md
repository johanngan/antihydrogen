Common utility functions shared by multiple different simulations. Run `make libs` to compile.

# Compiled Libraries
- lreadcfg contains simple config file parsing for numeric parameters
- liotag contains specific string manipulation methods for data input and output filenames

# Template Libraries
- timestepping.hpp contains libraries for solving ODE systems with explicit timestepping methods (2nd and 4th order Runge-Kutta, 5th order adaptive Runge-Kutta)
